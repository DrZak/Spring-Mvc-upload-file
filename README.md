This tutorial is about how to implement file upload functionality with Spring MVC framework. To handle file uploads, Spring provides a MultipartResolver bean which is responsible for resolving multipart request. This resolver is working with two file upload libraries:

 

Apache Commons File Upload: The bean class is org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartResolver
COS (com.oreilly.servlet): The bean class is org.springframework.web.multipart.cos.CosMultipartResolver
 

We need to declare the MultipartResolver bean in Springâ€™s context file as follows:

 

For CommonsMultipartResolver:

 
 
<bean id="multipartResolver"
    class="org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartResolver">
    <!-- max file size in bytes -->
    <property name="maxUploadSize" value="2000000" />
    <!-- other properties... -->
</bean>
 

 And for CosMultipartResolver:
 
<bean id="multipartResolver"
    class="org.springframework.web.multipart.cos.CosMultipartResolver">
    <!-- max file size in bytes -->
    <property name="maxUploadSize" value="2000000" />
    <!-- other properties... -->
</bean>
Also we need to add to classpath jar files of the file upload library employed:

For Apache Commons File Upload: commons-fileupload-VERSION.jar and commons-io-VERSION.jar (Commons File Upload depends on Commons IO).
For COS: cos.jar
As Apache Commons File Upload is popular and preferred over COS, this tutorial will use it. We will build a Spring MVC application which has an upload form looks like in the following screenshot:
